✅ Steps Performed

Import Libraries

Load & Inspect Data (. head(), . info(), . isnull(). sum())

Summary Statistics (. describe())

Univariate Plots - For numeric variables we can use box plots, and for categorical variables we can use histograms to understand distribution. A box plot tells us the median, interquartile range, and clearly identifies outliers.values so in my opinion boxplot is enough for understanding the shape.

Correlation Analysis – Heatmap, pairplot from seaborn.

Crosstab Analysis – Barplots of gender .
